        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Oregon. I moved to Colorado when I was 19 years old.
            I originally started in Colorado Springs and resided there for 6 years before moving 
        to the rockie mountains where I am now, between Vail and Keystone. </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>After making the big move to CO, I got really into snow sports. I picked up snowboarding
            and have made it to roughly 100 days per winter season on the mountain. I got comfortable 
            with snowboarding and decided to pick up <a href="https://www.hovlandsnowskates.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4b2MBhD2ARIsAIrcB-QZ21vdHtNDBjKyQg0WIhyYdfMTKUMjOW4jOYPSEfVFGWhEI8EX-o0aAiloEALw_wcB">
                snowskating</a>. A new and challenging snow sport that I can't wait to master!
        </p>
        <h2>Home Life</h2>
        <p>When I'm not on the mountain shredding, I spend a lot of time in the house. I have a 3 year old
            Shiba Inu that has been the best dog I've ever had along with her kitten. The kitten may be the most 
            evil cat ever but they happen to love each other. I enjoying cooking quite a bit and am constantly trying
            new recipes!
